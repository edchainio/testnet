- [Cambridge](http://assets.cambridge.org) hosts a remarkable amount of content that shares a promising canonical permalink structure; generalizing _http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/24972/frontmatter/9780521824972_frontmatter.pdf_ as _%scheme%://%authority%/%first-integer%/%second-integer%/%publication-section%/%first-integer%%second-integer%\_%publication-section%.%filename-extension%_ reveals a naming convention: concatenating the _concatenated name for a section of a publication_ to the _concatenated integers in the path to the filename_ and seperating them by an underscore form the stem of the filename.
